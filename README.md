# HoloSnake - A holographic microscopy GUI in Python

HoloSnake is a GUI for holographic microscopy written in Python.

It is developed at [Mike Hughes' lab'](https://research.kent.ac.uk/applied-optics/hughes)  
in the [Applied Optics Group](https://research.kent.ac.uk/applied-optics/), School of Physics & Astronomy, 
University of Kent.

HoloSnake is built on [CAS](https://www.github.com/mikehugheskent/cas) and [PyHoloscope](https://www.github.com/mikehugheskent/pyholoscope). 
It is not currently documented or tested outside of our 
specific applications and may be difficult to make sense of.

If you are looking for a documented package for holographic microscopy processing to build you own
processing pipeline/GUI around, take a look at [PyHoloscope](https://www.github.com/mikehugheskent/pyholoscope).
